# ActionApp
This is the prototype for an app that would allow you to call you representatives based on issues that have been selected and populated.  It turns out that a very similar app exists here and is open source (They are also a great group to work with!):

https://github.com/5calls

This app is a React-Native app built on the Exponent framework.  It uses Relay to connect to backend (Mobile directory)

The back end is implemented twice:
1) in straight GraphQL with a sql server backend(RelayServer directory)
2) in Graph.Cool (GraphCool directory)
